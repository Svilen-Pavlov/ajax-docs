## Description

I got the `Unexpected AJAX response was received from the server` error in a dialog. 

## Cause 

The possible causes for this issue may be any of the following:

* Some controls may use the `Server.Transfer()` internally, for example, the `asp:LoginView` control. 

* You may be using a custom HTTP handler.

* Incorrect loading of an AJAX-enabled user control. 

## Solution 

To solve this issue and depending on your case, use the following approaches: 

* (`Server.Transfer()`) To redirect to another page in an AJAX-enabled application, use the approaches from the article on [redirecting to another page]({%slug ajaxpanel/how-to/redirecting-to-another-page%}). To solve this issue, utilize `Response.Redirect`. You can also try using the `Redirect` method of the Ajax control you use.

* (Incorrect loading of user control) Refer to the article on [loading user controls]({%slug ajaxpanel/how-to/load-user-controls%}).

If the suggested solutions do not fix the issue, disable AJAX as suggested in the error message. Verify that you don't get a server-side exception or any other undesired behavior by setting the `EnableAJAX` property to `false`. This approach will help you verify whether the error is related to using AJAX and, if not, to fix any server-side errors if any are thrown.
