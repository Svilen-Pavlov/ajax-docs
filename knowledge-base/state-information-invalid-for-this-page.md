## Description

A `The state information is invalid for this page and might be corrupted` error occurs. 

## Cause  

Firefox version 1.5 and later use in-memory caching for entire web pages, including their JavaScript states, for a single browser session. Going backward and forward between visited pages requires no page loading and the JavaScript states are preserved. This feature, referred to by some as bfcache (for "Back-Forward Cache"), makes page navigation very fast. The caching state is preserved until the user closes the browser. 

## Solution 

To work around this issue, refer to the article on [using Ajax, ViewState, and Firefox]({%slug ajaxpanel/troubleshooting/firefox-specifics%}).
